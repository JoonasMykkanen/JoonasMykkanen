# Hi there & welcome to my github👋
Here I store ALL of my school and hobby projects. No matter how old or how "bad" they are... you will find them here. Maybe they showcase learning curve if nothing else.

## Some of my 🔥 project's that I'm proud of

### [Miner DashBoard - Crypto miner automation to next level ▶️](https://github.com/JoonasMykkanen/spotprice)
Python backend to run and automate my miner based on electricity spot price. Also gathers all relevant data
like revenue, operating costs and profits as well as power consumption. This all is displayed in a
Apple style dashboard.

### [miniRT - update to nvidias RTX technology ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minirt)
Basic raytracer, somewhat heavy introduction to computer graphics.

### [Minishell - overtaking Bash ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minishell)
My very own shell, took Bash as reference.

### [pwm fader ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/pwm_fader)
Proof on concept about my mentality, Give me 2 weeks and i'll learn anything!    

### [Philosophers ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/philosophers)
A multithreaded simulation. There is some spaghetti🍝 and few hundy philosophers🧙🏼‍♂️ fighting for it.

## Here are some of my older school projects 📚
