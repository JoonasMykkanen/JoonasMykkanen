# Hi there & welcome to my github👋

### Here are some of my school project's 📚
These project's are on my github but please don't pay too much attention to them
since the code quality and structure is outdated, they are first project's we did
while learning basics so they do not offer best reference to my skills as of now.
- libft
- ft_printf
- FdF
- push_swap

## Some of my 🔥 project's that I'm proud of 😎
### pwm fader [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/pwm_fader)
`Proof on concept about my mentality, Give me 2 weeks and i'll learn anything!`
```This is rather small one in terms of lines of code, but it is the journey that lead me to these specific lines of code that I am proud of.
Also this was done before my studies started, I went into this with 0 coding experience and 0 electrical engineering knowledge.
```

### Minishell [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minishell)
Really just reinventing fire here...

### Philosophers [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/philosophers)
A multithreaded simulation. There is some spaghetti and hunry philosophers fighting for it.

### I have experience with following technologies
