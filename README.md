# Hi there & welcome to my github👋
Here I store ALL of my school and hobby project's. No matter how old or how "bad" they are... you will find them here. Maybe they showcase learning curve if nothing else.

## Some of my 🔥 project's that I'm proud of 😎

### [miniRT - update to nvidias RTX technology ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minirt)
Basic raytracer, somewhat heavy introduction to computer graphics.

### [Minishell - overtaking Bash ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minishell)
My very own shell, took Bash as reference.

### [pwm fader ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/pwm_fader)
Proof on concept about my mentality, Give me 2 weeks and i'll learn anything!    

### [Philosophers ▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/philosophers)
A multithreaded simulation. There is some spaghetti🍝 and few hundy philosophers🧙🏼‍♂️ fighting for it.

## Here are some of my school project's 📚
These project's are on my github but please don't pay too much attention to them
since the code quality and structure is outdated, they are first project's we did
while learning basics so they do not offer best reference to my skills as of now.
- libft - (c stdlib functions rewrite)
- ft_printf - (the myth, the legend, printf, rewritten)
- FdF - (height map rendering)
- get_next_line - (function to read file line by line)
- minitalk - (binary communication between processes)
- push_swap - (sorting algo)
