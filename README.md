### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Here are some of my school project's ðŸ“š
These project's are on my github but please dont pay too much attention to them
since the code quality and structure is outdated, they are first project's we did
while learning basics so quality is not where it is with later ones.
- Libft
- ft_printf
- FdF
- GetNextLine

### Some of my ðŸ”¥ project's
#### push_swap 
Sorting algorithm, at first glance I thought it will be boring project but afterwards it turned out to
be super interesting learning experience!
#### Minishell
Custom shell we created with bash as a reference. This one really made us dive deep into details and code structure since the scope
of the project was multiple times bigger than anything else before.
#### Fullstack open
Not one project as is but a course of fullstack developement that I have liked a alot.

### I have experience with following technologies
