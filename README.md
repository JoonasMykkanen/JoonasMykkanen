# Hi there & welcome to my github👋

## Here are some of my school project's 📚
These project's are on my github but please don't pay too much attention to them
since the code quality and structure is outdated, they are first project's we did
while learning basics so they do not offer best reference to my skills as of now.
- libft
- ft_printf
- FdF
- push_swap

## Some of my 🔥 project's that I'm proud of 😎

### pwm fader [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/pwm_fader)
#### Proof on concept about my mentality, Give me 2 weeks and i'll learn anything!💯           

This is rather small project in terms of lines of code, but it is the journey that led me here that I am proud of. Also this was done before my studies started so, I went into this with 0 experience in either of the fields.

### Minishell [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/minishell)
Making my own version of shell, used bash as a reference. Somewhat tedious🙃

### Philosophers [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/philosophers)
A multithreaded simulation. There is some spaghetti🍝 and few hundy philosophers🧙🏼‍♂️ fighting for it.

### libft [▶️](https://github.com/joonasmykkanen/libft)
We started our school back @ stoneage🗿 Had to reinvent fire🔥 (C stdlib)

## I have experience with following technologies ✅
